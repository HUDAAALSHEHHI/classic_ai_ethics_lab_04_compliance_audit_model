üß† Comprehensive Experiment Overview

This experiment focuses on evaluating how artificial intelligence systems can autonomously verify their compliance with legal and cybersecurity standards. The model analyzes datasets containing attributes such as consent, sensitivity level, and data source, then classifies each entry as either compliant or violating. By implementing simple yet representative logic, the goal is to demonstrate how rule-based or hybrid compliance checks can form the foundation for more advanced auditing systems in enterprise AI contexts.


‚úèÔ∏è Objective

To build a lightweight compliance verification system capable of identifying policy violations, missing user consent, and sensitive data exposure. The experiment aims to illustrate how automated detection pipelines can enhance corporate governance and reduce the risk of legal non-compliance in large-scale data-driven applications.

üìò Results

The model successfully detected two primary categories of violations:


Records involving external data sources without explicit user consent.


Instances where sensitive information was found in public datasets.
This confirms the model‚Äôs ability to perform automatic regulatory checks and highlights how algorithmic auditing can supplement human compliance teams in identifying risks early.


üìó Observations


The logical rules applied in this experiment can be extended using NLP or semantic reasoning to assess unstructured legal documents.


Integrating federated learning techniques could improve privacy-preserving audits by keeping sensitive data decentralized.


This experiment provides a foundation for real-time compliance dashboards, where organizations continuously monitor adherence to frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA, and ISO 27001.


The overall insight reinforces that legal integrity is not achieved solely by enforcement‚Äîbut by embedding ethics and security awareness directly within AI design.
